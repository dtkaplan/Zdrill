[] -2
[] -4
[a] 2 [The rate of change in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from $a$ to $b$ is $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$$ This doesn't depend on the order of $a$ and $b$, so the rate of change is the same when the input goes from $a$ to $b$ as when it goes from $b$ to $a.$]

[] -2
[a] 0.3 [$f(3.1) = 7.3$ and $f(3) = 7$, so $f(3.1) - f(3) = 0.3$.]
[] 2

[a] It's missing part of the `<-` token.
[]  `x` is an improper name.

**assign2** What's wrong with this assignment statement?<br> `3*x <- 4` [M2]

[] Nothing [The item to the left of `<-` needs to be a valid name. `3*x` is not.]
[] It should use addition instead of multiplication.
[a] The item to the left of `<-` needs to be a name [`3 * x` is an instruction to multiply 3 times x. It is not a name.]
[] There's no `x` on the right-hand side of the assignment arrow.

**assign3** What's wrong with this assignment statement?<br> `x -> 3+4` [M2]

[] Nothing
[] You can't use addition in an assignment statement. [You can, but it has to be on the right side of the assignment, where you construct the value to be assigned to the name on the left side.]
[a] The assignment has to point toward the **name**, not the *value*

**assign4** We can write something like <br>$f(x) \equiv x^2$ </br> in mathematical notation. Is it legit in R to write `f(x) <- x^2` ? [M2]

[] Yes, it's fine.
[a] `f(x)` is not a valid name in R.
[] Almost. You need to use \(\equiv\) instead of `<-` . [There's no symbol \(\equiv\) on the keyboard or recognized in the R language.]

**M3-notation-1** Using our notation conventions from the textbook, which one of the following kinds of things is $y_0 ?$ [M3]

[a] A constant
[] A function name
[] An input name [A subscript (like $_0$ here) or non-numeric superscript (like $^\star$) on what would otherwise be an input name will be instead a **constant**.]

**M4-notation-2** Using our notation conventions from the textbook, which one of the following kinds of things is $t^\star?$ [M4]

[a] A constant
[] A function name
[] An input name [A subscript (like $_0$ here) or non-numeric superscript (like $^\star$) on what would otherwise be an input name will be instead a **constant**.]

**M4-notation-3** Using our notation conventions from the textbook, which one of the following kinds of things is $B ?$ [M4]

[a] A constant
[] A function name
[] An input name [The letters from the start of the alphabet, a-d, or A-D will refer to a **constant**. ]

**M4-notation-4** Using our notation conventions from the textbook, which one of the following kinds of things is $F() ?$ [M4]

[] A constant
[a] A function name [Our standard pronouns for functions are $f(), g(), h()$ and $F(), G(), H()$]

**M4-notation-5** Using our notation conventions from the textbook, which one of the following kinds of things is $u ?$ [M4]

[] A constant
[] A function name 
[a] An input name [Letters from the end of the alphabet, $u, v, w, x, y, z$, generally refer to an input to a function. But, remember, something like $x_0$ will always be a constant.]

**M4-notation-6** Can function names be multiple letters, e.g. `g3()` or `altitude()`? [M4]

[a] Yes [And they often do. Almost all R functions have multi-letter names, like `exp()`, `sin()`, `dnorm()`, and such. When you are building a model, it's helpful to use *mnemonic* function names rather than the usual pronouns like $f(), g()$, an $h()$. We use the short pronouns throughout the book whenever we are discussing general mathematical properties rather than specific models.]
[] No

**M4-notation-7** Can function names have subscripts or superscripts, like $g_0()$ or  $f'() ?$ [M4]

[a] Yes [We'll use names like $g_0()$, $g_1()$ in sequence when we're discussing a set of functions that are very closely related, such as refinements?]
[] No

**M4-notation-8** In the book, will input names have subscripts, like $x_0$ or  $u_2 ?$ [M4]

[] Yes 
[a] No [In the textbook, we try to reserve names like $x_0$ or $u_2$ for **constants**. But mathematics usage generally doesn't always adopt this helpful convention.]

**M4-notation-9** In the book, what is meant by the word "**variable**"? [M4]

[] It's the same as input. [Use **input** rather than variable! Even if you're used to calling quantities like $x$ and $y$ variables, it's a confusing practice since it can mean so many different things. In calculus, in this course, we'll try to be strict about using the words **input** and **output**]
[] It's the same as output.
[+] A column in a data table. [This is the use in statistics and data science. In calculus, we'll try to avoid confusing by using **input** and **output** instead.]

[a] Yes
[] No

**arg12** Will this statement work in R? <br>`Sin(4)`</br> [M4]

[] Yes [It would except for the capital S. R treats capital and lower-case letters as completely different, so the name `abby` is utterly distinct from `Abby` or `aBBy`, etc.]
[a] No

**arg13** Will this statement work in R to calculate $\sin(4)$? <br> `sin[4]` [M4]

[] Yes [You must always use parentheses, not square braces, to carry the argument to the function.]
[a] No [Only parentheses can be used to hand an argument off to a function.]

**arg14** What is the output from the command `log(-1)` ? [M4]

[] 0 [Sorry, but $\ln(1) \rightarrow 0$, not $\ln(-1)$.

**arg15** What is the output from the command `log(0)` ? [M4]

[] 0
[a] -Inf [There's a vertical asymptote involved here, so the programmers who wrote `log()` decided to tell you which direction it goes in.]
[] NaN

[] The name of the function being applied to the three arguments.
[] A named argument
[a] An argument to be used without a name.

**arg14** Will the statement `pnorm(x=3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` ?  [M4]

[] Yes, same arguments to the same function means the output will be the same. [In general, this is good reasoning. ]
[a] No. The name of the first argument to `pnorm()` is not `x`. [You can't always know what are the names of the arguments to the basic built-in functions. So use them without naming the argument.]

**arg15** Will the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, sd=6, mean=4)`?  [M4]

[a] Yes. [The names for the arguments tell R how each argument should be used in the function.]
[] No. The arguments are different. [When an argument is used with it's name, it can go anywhere in the argument list.]

**arg16** Will the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, sd=4, mean=6)`?  [M4]

[] Yes [Look carefully at the value given to each argument.]
[a] No [In the first statement, the mean is set to 4, while in the second it's set to 6.]

**arg17** What is the value of `sin(180)`? [M4]

[a] -0.80 [The argument to trigonometric functions is interpreted by R to be in **radians**.]
[] 0 [This would be right if sine interpreted its argument in *degrees*. But arguments to the trigonometric functions in R and most other languages are in **radians**." $\sin(\pi) = 0$.]
[] 0.80 [You've got the sign incorrect.]
[] 1 [The argument to `sin()` is in radians.]

**desc01** What is the value of `16^1/2`? [M4]

[] 4 [This would be right if the exponent were in grouping parentheses, e.e. `16^(1/2)`. Without those parentheses, the computer reads `16^1/2` as `(16^1) / 2`]
[a] 8 

**desc02** What is the value of `16^(1/2)`? [M4]


[a] 4 [Since the `(1/2)` is in grouping parentheses, the expression is asking for 16 to the one-half power, in other words the square root of 16.]
[] 8

**desc03** Suppose `n <- 3`. What will be the value of `2^n-1`? [M4]


[] 4 [Without grouping parentheses around `n-1` the computer interprets `2^n-1` as `(2^n) - 1`]
[a] 7
[] 8 [What about the `-1` in the expression?]

**desc04** Suppose `n <- 3`. What will be the value of `2^(n-1)`? [M4]

[a] 4 
[] 7 [The grouping parentheses around `(n-1)` mean that the calculation is effectively `2^2`, giving 4.]

[] `slice_plot(pnorm(x) ~ x, domain(x=(-4, 4))` [The end-points of the domain need to be collected by the function `c()`, so the argument to `domain()` should be `x=c(-4,4)` not `x=(-4, 4)`]
[] `slice_plot(pnorm(x) ~ y, domain(x=c(-4, 4)))` [The name of the input to the function being graphed, `x` here, needs to be stated on the right-hand side of the tilde expression. So use `pnorm(x) ~ x` rather than `pnorm(x) ~ y`]
[] None of them correspond to the plot.

**M4-03** Only one of the following commands will successfully generate the graph of a function. Which one? [M4]

[+] `slice_plot(exp(y) ~ y, domain(y=c(-4, 4)))` [Perhaps you were mislead by my using `y` as the name of the input to the function. You can use whatever name you like so long as you use it **consistently** in the whole command.]
[] `slice_plot(pnorm(x) ~ x, domain(y=c(-4, 4)))` [The domain has been specified using the name `y` rather than the input name used in the tilde expression.]
[] `slice_plot(log(x) ~ x, domain(x=c(0; 10)))` [The arguments to `c()` are illegally separated by a semi-colon rather than the mandated comma.]
[] `slice_plot(dnorm(y)) ~ x, domain(y=c(-3,3)))` [The `x` on the right-hand side of the tilde expression is inconsistent with the use of `y` as the input name elsewhere in the command.]
