[a] True
[] False

**legitnames2** Is `x_x` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[a] True
[] False

**legitnames3** Is `-x` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[] True
[a] False [The minus sign are other such symbols are not allowed characters in an R name.]

**legitnames4** Is `3x` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[] True
[a] False [Names should start with a letter]

**legitnames5** Is `x3` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[a] True [Numbers are OK in names, so long as the first character is a letter]
[] False

**legitnames6** Is `sqrt` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[a] True [In fact, it is the name of an oft-used function in R.]
[] False

**legitnames7** Is `x + y` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[] True
[a] False [`x + y` is an R expression that uses names, but the expression is not itself a name.]

**legitnames8** Is `3 * x` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[] True
[a] False [`*` and <space> are not acceptable characters in a name.]

**legitnames9** Is `xprime` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

[a] True
[] False

**legitnames10** Is `x prime` a legitimate name in R? [Group 2]

**assign1** What's wrong with this assignment statement?<br> `x < 4` [Group 2]

[] Nothing
[a] It's missing part of the `<-` token.
[]  `x` is an improper name.

**assign2** What's wrong with this assignment statement?<br> `3*x <- 4` [Group 2]

[] Nothing [The item to the left of `<-` needs to be a valid name. `3*x` is not.]
[] It should use addition instead of multiplication.
[a] The item to the left of `<-` needs to be a name [`3 * x` is an instruction to multiply 3 times x. It is not a name.]
[] There's no `x` on the right-hand side of the assignment arrow.

**assign3** What's wrong with this assignment statement?<br> `x -> 3+4` [Group 2]

[] Nothing
[] You can't use addition in an assignment statement. [You can, but it has to be on the right side of the assignment, where you construct the value to be assigned to the name on the left side.]
[a] The assignment has to point toward the **name**, not the *value*

**assign4** We can write something like <br>$f(x) \equiv x^2$ </br> in mathematical notation. Is it legit in R to write `f(x) <- x^2` ? [Group 2]

[] Yes, it's fine.
[a] `f(x)` is not a valid name in R.
[] Almost. You need to use \(\equiv\) instead of `<-` . [There's no symbol \(\equiv\) on the keyboard or recognized in the R language.]

**arg11** Will this statement work in R? <br>`sin(4)` [Group 3]

[a] Yes
[] No

**arg12** Will this statement work in R? <br>`Sin(4)`</br> [Group 3]

[] Yes [It would except for the capital S. R treats capital and lower-case letters as completely different, so the name `abby` is utterly distinct from `Abby` or `aBBy`, etc.]
[a] No

**arg13** Will this statement work in R to calculate $\sin(4)$? <br> `sin[4]` [Group 3]

[] Yes [You must always use parentheses, not square braces, to carry the argument to the function.]
[a] No [Only parentheses can be used to hand an argument off to a function.]

**arg14** What is the output from the command `log(-1)` ? [Group 3]

[] 0 [Sorry, but $\ln(1) \rightarrow 0$, not $\ln(-1)$.
[] An error message. [A warning is different from an error.]
[] -Inf
[a] NaN [\(-1\) is outside of the domain of the logarithm function.]

**arg15** What is the output from the command `log(0)` ? [Group 3]

[] 0
[a] -Inf [There's a vertical asymptote involved here, so the programmers who wrote `log()` decided to tell you which direction it goes in.]
[] NaN

**arg16** Which of these phrases is most appropriate for describing what the R command `z <- sin(17)` is doing?  [Group 3]

[] Gives a name to a value.
[a] Applies a function to an input to produce an output.
[] Makes a copy of an existing object.
[] The name of an object.
[] It's invalid as a command.

**arg17** Which of these phrases is most appropriate for describing what the R command `sin(17)` is doing?  [Group 3]

[] Gives a name to a value.
[a] Applies a function to an input to produce an output.
[] Makes a copy of an existing object.
[] The name of an object.
[] It's invalid as a command.

**arg18** Which of these phrases is most appropriate for describing what the R command `z <- x` is doing?  [Group 3]

[] Gives a name to a value.
[] Applies a function to an input to produce an output.
[a] Makes a copy of an existing object.
[] The name of an object.
[] It's invalid as a command.

**arg10** Which of these phrases is most appropriate for describing what the R command `fred` is doing?  [Group 3]

[] Gives a name to a value.
[] Applies a function to an input to produce an output.
[] Makes a copy of an existing object.
[a] The name of an object. [When you give the name of an object as a stand-alone command, R prints out the value of that object.]
[] It's invalid as a command.

**arg11** In the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6 )`, what is `pnorm`?  [Group 3]

[a] The name of the function being applied to the three arguments.
[] A named argument
[] An argument to be used without a name.

**arg12** In the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6 )`, what is `mean=4`?  [Group 3]

[] The name of the function being applied to the three arguments.
[a] A named argument
[] An argument to be used without a name.

**arg13** In the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6 )`, what is `3`?  [Group 3]

[] The name of the function being applied to the three arguments.
[] A named argument
[a] An argument to be used without a name.

**arg14** Will the statement `pnorm(x=3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` ?  [Group 3]

[] Yes, same arguments to the same function means the output will be the same. [In general, this is good reasoning. ]
[a] No. The name of the first argument to `pnorm()` is not `x`. [You can't always know what are the names of the arguments to the basic built-in functions. So use them without naming the argument.]

**arg15** Will the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, sd=6, mean=4)`?  [Group 3]

[a] Yes. [The names for the arguments tell R how each argument should be used in the function.]
[] No. The arguments are different. [When an argument is used with it's name, it can go anywhere in the argument list.]

**arg16** Will the statement `pnorm(3, mean=4, sd=6)` give the same result as `pnorm(3, sd=4, mean=6)`?  [Group 3]

[] Yes [Look carefully at the value given to each argument.]
[a] No [In the first statement, the mean is set to 4, while in the second it's set to 6.]

**arg17** What is the value of `sin(180)`? [Group 3]

[a] -0.80 [The argument to trigonometric functions is interpreted by R to be in **radians**.]
[] 0 [This would be right if sine interpreted its argument in *degrees*. But arguments to the trigonometric functions in R and most other languages are in **radians**." $\sin(\pi) = 0$.]
[] 0.80 [You've got the sign incorrect.]
[] 1 [The argument to `sin()` is in radians.]

**desc01** What is the value of `16^1/2`? [Group 4]

[] 4 [This would be right if the exponent were in grouping parentheses, e.e. `16^(1/2)`. Without those parentheses, the computer reads `16^1/2` as `(16^1) / 2`]
[a] 8 

**desc02** What is the value of `16^(1/2)`? [Group 4]


[a] 4 [Since the `(1/2)` is in grouping parentheses, the expression is asking for 16 to the one-half power, in other words the square root of 16.]
[8]

**desc03** Suppose `n <- 3`. What will be the value of `2^n-1`? [Group 4]


[] 4 [Without grouping parentheses around `n-1` the computer interprets `2^n-1` as `(2^n) - 1`]
[a] 7
[] 8 [What about the `-1` in the expression?]

**desc04** Suppose `n <- 3`. What will be the value of `2^(n-1)`? [Group 4]

[a] 4 
[] 7 [The grouping parentheses around `(n-1)` mean that the calculation is effectively `2^2`, giving 4.]
[] 8 [What about the `-1` in the expression?]
