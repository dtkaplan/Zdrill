**dim01** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally  alid? $$a / c$$ Why or why not?[Dimensions]

[+] Division can accommodate any two quantities, regardless of dimension.
[] $c$ is a dimensionless quantity. [$c$ is dimensionless, but that's not a complete explanation. For instance, $a + c$ would not be dimensionally valid.]
[] You can only divide two quantities of the same dimension. [That's just wrong. Division is valid regardless of dimension.]

**dim02** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\sqrt{a}$$ Why or why not?[Dimensions]

[+] Invalid. You can't have a non-integer exponent on a dimension.
[] Valid. It's simply 5. [You forgot about the "feet" unit. That's dimension L and there is no such thing as $L^{1/2}$.]
[] Invalid. 25 feet is not a valid quantity. [25 feet is a perfectly ordinary quantity. The issue is with the $\sqrt{\ \ \ }$]

**dim03** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$b^c$$ Why or why not?[Dimensions]

[] Invalid. Exponentiation of a dimensionful quantity isn't allowed. [Exponention is allowed, so long as the exponent is an integer (or if the operation results in an integer exponent)]
[+] Valid. Exponentiation by a dimensionless integer is always allowed. []
[] Invalid. I can't make any sense out of T$^4$ as a dimension. [Get used to such things. What matters is whether the construction follows the rules. You'll often encounter compound dimensions that seem crazy complicated. For instance, foot-pounds (L$^2$MT$^{-2}$) is a perfectly familiar unit to a mechanic.]

**dim04** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$c^b$$ Why or why not?[Dimensions]

[+] Invalid. Exponentiation by a dimensionful quantity isn't allowed. [Exponention is allowed, so long as the exponent is an integer (or if the operation results in an integer exponent)]
[] Valid. Exponentiation by a dimensionless integer is always allowed. [$b$ isn't a dimensionless integer; it's 3 hours!]
[] Valid. You can do what you want with plain (dimensionless) numbers like 4. [Sorry, but you can't add a dimensionless quantity to a dimensionful quantity, no can you raise a dimensionless quantity to a dimensionful power.]

**dim05** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\sqrt[3]{a^2 d}$$ Why or why not?[Dimensions]

[] Invalid. You can't raise a dimensionful quantity to a non-integer power. [You can always raise a dimensionful quantity to an integer power. And, if the result of raising to the non-integer power is to produce dimensions that have integer powers, that is valid, too.]
[+] Valid. $a^2 d$ is a volume: L$^3$. The cube root of L$^3$ is L. 
[] Invalid. 25 feet squared is 625 square feet. It makes no sense to multiply square feet by meters. [Why not? 625 square-feet meters is a volume. It has dimension L$^3$. Admittedly a strange unit, but no stranger than the "acre-foot" used to measure agricultural irrigation.]

**dim06** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\exp(a d)$$ Why or why not? [Dimensions]

[+] Invalid. The input to $\exp()$ must be a dimensionless quantity. [$a d$ has dimension L$^2$ (with units of feet-meters).]
[] Valid. The $a$ cancels out the dimension of the $b$. [No it doesn't. $a d$ has dimension L$^2$.] 
[] Invalid. 25 foot-meters doesn't mean anything. [Yes it does. It's the area of a rectangle that is 25 feet long and one meter wide.]

**dim07** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\exp(c d)$$ Why or why not? [Dimensions]

[+] Invalid. The input to $\exp()$ must be a dimensionless quantity. [$c d$ has dimension L.]
[] Valid. The dimension will be L$^4$ [This would be right for the combination $d^c$, but $\exp(c d)$ is completely different.] 
[] Invalid. $c d$ has dimension L. [The dimension of $c d$ is indeed L, but you can't have an argument to $\exp()$ that is dimensionful.]

**dim08** Consider these quantities:<br>$a = 25$ ft <br>$b = 3$ hours<br>$c = 4$<br>$d = 1$ meter<br>$e = 2.718$<br> Is this combination dimensionally valid? $$\exp(c/d)$$ Why or why not? [Dimensions]

[] Invalid. The input to $\exp()$ must be a dimensionless quantity. [$c / d$ is dimensionless.]
[] Valid. The L dimension of $c$ is cancelled out by the L$^{-1}$ dimension of $1/d$ [This would be right for the combination $d^c$, but $\exp(c d)$ is completely different.] 
[] Invalid. $c / d$ has dimension L$^{-1}$. [Check your arithmetic!]
