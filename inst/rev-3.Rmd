**D01**   Which pattern-book function is the **derivative** of the sigmoid function pnorm()? That is, $${\large \text{pnorm}(x)}  \underset{\scriptsize \text{anti-diff}}{{\stackrel{\text{diff}}{\ \ \ \ {\Huge\rightleftharpoons}\ \ \ }}}  {\LARGE ?}$$  [Pattern-book derivs]

[] Reciprocal $1/x$  [The anti-derivative of the reciprocal is the natural logarithm.]
[] Exponential $e^x$ [The anti-derivative of the exponential is the exponential.]
[] Sinusoid $\sin(x)$  [The anti-derivative of a sinusoid is a shifted sinusoid.]
[+] Gaussian dnorm(x)  [The anti-derivative of the gaussian is the sigmoid.]
[] Constant $1$ [The anti-derivative of the constant function is the identity function $x$.]

**D02** Which pattern-book function is the **anti-derivative** of the reciprocal $1/x$? That is, $${\LARGE ?}  \underset{\scriptsize \text{anti-diff}}{{\stackrel{\text{diff}}{\ \ \ \ {\Huge\rightleftharpoons}\ \ \ }}}  {\large \frac{1}{x}}$$<br> <br> NOTE: Differentiation produces a "child" function from a "parent" function. The child is the derivative of the parent. Putting the relationship the other way, the parent is the **anti-derivative** of the child. "Derivative" and "anti-derivative" are two ways of looking at the same relationship between a pair of functions. So, if $f(x)$ is the derivative of $F(x)$, then $F(x)$ is the anti-derivative of $f(x)$. [Pattern-book derivs]

[] Reciprocal $1/x$  [The derivative of the reciprocal is $- x^{-2}$.]

[] Constant $1$ [The derivative of the constant function is the zero function.]

**D03** Which pattern-book function is the **anti-derivative** of the gaussian $\text{dnorm()}$? That is, $${\LARGE ?}  \underset{\scriptsize \text{anti-diff}}{{\stackrel{\text{diff}}{\ \ \ \ {\Huge\rightleftharpoons}\ \ \ }}}  {\large \text{dnorm}(x)}$$<br> <br> NOTE: Differentiation produces a "child" function from a "parent" function. The child is the derivative of the parent. Putting the relationship the other way, the parent is the **anti-derivative** of the child. "Derivative" and "anti-derivative" are two ways of looking at the same relationship between a pair of functions. So, if $f(x)$ is the derivative of $F(x)$, then $F(x)$ is the anti-derivative of $f(x)$. In other words: $${\large F(x)}  \underset{\scriptsize \text{anti-diff}}{{\stackrel{\text{diff}}{\ \ \ \ {\Huge\rightleftharpoons}\ \ \ }}}  {\Large f(x)}$$ [Pattern-book derivs]

[+] Exponential and sinusoid  
[] Exponential and sigmoid [The second derivative of the sigmoid is $-x\, \text{dnorm}(x)$.]
[] Exponential and logarithm  [The second derivative of the logarithm is $-x^{-2}$]
[] Sinusoid and gaussian  [The second derivative of the gaussian is far from obvious at first glance: $(x^2 - 1) \text{dnorm}(x)$. Don't freak out; you aren't expected to memorize this one!]


**D06** What is the **derivative** of $t^5$ with respect to $t$? That is, $${\Large t^5}  \underset{\scriptsize \text{anti-diff}}{{\stackrel{\text{diff}}{\ \ \ \ {\Huge\rightleftharpoons}\ \ \ }}}  {\Large ?}$$[Pattern-book derivs]

[+] $5 t^4$ 
[] $4 t^5$ [Remember, $\partial_t t^p = p\, t^{p-1}$]

[] $\frac{1}{4} t^5$

[] $2 x$ [As per the power-law rule for differentiation.] 
[+] $2$
[] $2 x^2$
[] $2/x$


**D08**   What is $\partial_t \sin(x)$   [Pattern-book derivs]

[] $\cos(x)$ [Tricked you! We asked about the partial with respect to $t$, not the partial with respect to $x$. There's no $t$ in $\sin(x)$. So far as $t$ is concerned, $\sin(x)$ is a constant.]
[+] 0 
[] $-\sin(x)$  [Tricked you! We asked about the partial with respect to $t$, not the partial with respect to $x$. There's no $t$ in $\sin(x)$. So far as $t$ is concerned, $\sin(x)$ is a constant.]
[] $-\cos(x)$  [Tricked you! We asked about the partial with respect to $t$, not the partial with respect to $x$. There's no $t$ in $\sin(x)$. So far as $t$ is concerned, $\sin(x)$ is a constant.]


**D09** Suppose you know only this one fact about $f(x)$, that $\partial_{xx}\, f(7.3) = 1.6$. Which of these statements must be true?  [Pattern-book derivs]

[] $f(x)$ is increasing at $x=7.3$. [The first derivative $\partial_x f(x)$ would tell you about whether the function is increasing or decreasing. The second derivative $\partial_{xx} f(x)$ tells you about something else.]
[] $f(x)$ is concave up and decreasing at $x=7.3$ [Second derivatives tell you about concavity, but not about whether the function is increasing or decreasing.]
[] $f(x)$ is concave up at $x=7.3$ [The 2nd derivative tells you **only** about the concavity of a function. It has nothing to say about the value of the slope.]
[] $f(x)$ is concave up at $x=7.3$, but eventually it will become concave down.  [In a graph of a function, the second derivative corresponds to concavity. But knowing only the numerical value for the second derivative at a single input value does not tell you what the function is doing anywhere else.]


**D10** If $f(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=5$, can it possibly be **smooth** at $x=6$?  [Pattern-book derivs]

[+] Yes  [Discontinuity of a function at one input doesn't tell you what the function is doing at another input.]
[] No [We told you something about $f(x)$ at $x=5$. Just knowing that doesn't tell you about $f(x)$ at other inputs.]


**D11** If $g(x)$ is discontinuous at $x=1$, what will be the value of $\partial_x g(x)$ at $x=1$?   [Pattern-book derivs]

[] Depends on how big the gap is at the discontinuity.
[] 0
[] $1/x$ 
[a] The derivative isn't defined at a discontinuity.

**D12**   Which of the following is the correct construction for $\partial_t g(t)$?   [Pattern-book derivs]

[+] $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(t + h) - g(t)}{h}$
[] $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(t + h) - g(t)}{t}$ [The division should be by $h$, not by $t$.]
[] $\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(t) - g(t+h)}{h}$ [This will be the $- \partial_t g(t)$.]
[] $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{g(t + h) - g(t)}{h}$ [$x$ has nothing to do with it, so $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0}$ means nothing in this context.]

**D13** Which of these is a reasonable definition of a derivative?   [Pattern-book derivs]

[+] A derivative is a function whose value tells, for any input, the instantaneous rate of change of the function from which it was derived.
[] A derivative is the slope of a function. [For functions that aren't straight lines, it doesn't mean anything to speak of "the slope" because the slope varies from place to place. Always remember that the derivative of a function is another **function**.]
[] A derivative is a function whose value tells, for any input, the instantaneous change of the function from which it was derived. [Not a bad start but a crucial word was left out. It should say, "the instantaneous **rate** of change". "Instantaneous" and "rate" go hand in hand.]


**D14**   Which one of these is **not** the derivative of a pattern-book function?   [Pattern-book derivs]

[] Reciprocal [The reciprocal is the derivative of the logarithm.]
[] Zero [Zero is the derivative of the constant function.]
[] One [The constant function 1 is the derivative of the identity function $x$.]
[+] Sigmoid [There is some function whose derivative is the sigmoid, but it's not a function that we've discussed and it's not much (or ever!?) used in modeling.]

**D15** Which of the following shapes of functions is **not** allowed? You are **strongly** advised to try to draw each shape.  [Pattern-book derivs]

[] Increasing and concave up.
[] Decreasing and concave up.
[] Increasing and concave down.
[] Decreasing and concave down.
[] None of them are allowed.
[a] All of them are allowed. [The only restriction on mathematical functions is that for any given input, there can be at most one output.]
