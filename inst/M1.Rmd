**intro1** Which of these is the symbol for "is defined as"? [M1]

[] $=$ [An equals sign says that the two sides happen to be equal, not that the left side is **defined** as the right side.]
[+] $\equiv$ [Three parallel bars signify a definition.]
[] $\sim$
[] $\approx$

**intro2** What is the name of the function defined by $$f(y) \equiv \sin(y) + e^y \ ?$$ [M1]

[+] $f$ [Note that we will usually write function names with trailing parentheses, like $f()$, in order to remind you that $f$ refers to a function rather than an input or parameter or whatever.]
[] $\sin$
[] $f(y)$ [This isn't a function name. This is how we write the **output** from applying function $f()$ to the input denoted by the name $y$.]

**intro3**  How do we refer to the output generated by applying $g(x) \equiv x+3$ to the input 3?  [M1]

[] $g(x)$
[+] $g(3)$
[] $y = 6$ [It's a habit from high-school math to use the name $y$ for outputs. Breaking that habit will help you learn and use calculus.]


**intro4** What is the **value** of $f(4)$ when $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1\ ?$  [M1]

[] -2
[] -4
[] 2
[] 4
[a] 9


**intro5** What is the **change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 2 to 4? <br>Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$    [M1]

[] -4
[] -2
[] 2
[a] 4
[] 9


**intro6**  What is the **rate of change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 2 to 4? <br>Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$   [M1]

[] -2
[] -4
[a] 2
[] 4 [You've calculated the net change, not the rate of change.]
[] 9


**intro7** What is the **change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 4 to 2? <br>Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$   [M1]

[] -2
[a] -4
[] 2
[] 4 [The change in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from $a$ to $b$ is $f(b) - f(a)$]
[] 9


**intro8** What is the **rate of change** in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from 4 to 2? <br>Assume $f(x) \equiv 2 x + 1$   [M1]

[] -2
[] -4
[a] 2 [The rate of change in the value of $f()$ when the input goes from $a$ to $b$ is $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$$ This doesn't depend on the order of $a$ and $b$, so the rate of change is the same when the input goes from $a$ to $b$ as when it goes from $b$ to $a.$]
[] 4
[] 9


**intro9** What is the **rate of change** of the function $f(x) \equiv 3 x - 2$ when the input is 4?  [M1]

[] -2
[] 0.3
[] 2
[a] 3
[] 10 [This is the **value** of $f(4)$, not the rate of change at $x=4$.]

**intro10** What is the **change** in value of the  function $f(x) \equiv 3 x - 2$ as the input goes from 3 to 3.1?  [M1]

[] -2
[a] 0.3 [$f(3.1) = 7.3$ and $f(3) = 7$, so $f(3.1) - f(3) = 0.3$.]
[] 2
[] 3
[] 10

**intro11** What is the **rate of change** in value of the  function $$f(x) \equiv 3 x - 2$$ as the input goes from 3 to 3.1?  [M1]

[] -2
[] 0.3
[] 2
[a] 3 [The rate of change is $$\frac{f(3.1) - f(3)}{3.1 - 3}$$]
[] 10
