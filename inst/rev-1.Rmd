**rev1-18** What's wrong with this R command for defining a function?<br>`f <- 3*x + 2` [rev1]

[] It needs to be `f(x) <- 3*x + 2` [That's reminiscent of traditional notation but to create a function we use `f <- makeFun( ... )`]
[] It needs to be `f <- makeFun(3*x + 2)` [Almost, but you're missing the right-hand side of the tilde expression, `3*x ~ x`, which tells us that `x` will be the name of the argument to `f()`.]
[a] It needs to be `f <- makeFun(3*x + 2 ~ x)`.
[] Nothing is wrong

**rev1-19** What's wrong with this R command for creating an exponential function named `g`?<br> `g <- makeFun(e^y ~ y)` [rev1]

[+] `e^y` is not the exponential function [It should be `exp(y)`]
[] It uses `y` as the argument instead of `x`. [You can use any name you like for the argument, so long as you use it consistently.]
[] Better to name the argument `x` [`x` and `y` (and many others) are excellent names for arguments.]
[] Nothing

**rev1-20** What's suspect about this R command?<br> `g <- makeFun(exp(y) ~ x)` [rev1]

[a] The formula is `exp(y)` but the argument name is `x`
[] There's a tilde expression as the argument to `makeFun()`. [That's exactly what is supposed to happen: give a tilde expression as the input to `makeFun()` !]
[] The function name should be `G`, not `g`. [The function name is your choice! Either would be right.]
[] Nothing [I guess that "suspect" is in the eye of the beholder. But I think there's a better choice here.]

**rev1-21** What's wrong with the R expression `sin*(x + 3)`? [rev1]

[a] There is no function named `sin*()` [And besides, `*` cannot be part of any valid name in R.]
[] It should be `sin+(x+3)` [There's no function named `sin+()`]
[] It should be `sin^(x+3)` [There is no function named `sin^()`]
[] Nothing [Hint: What's the name of the function being used? Is that really a function?]

**rev1-22** What does `e^3` mean in R? [rev1]

[] It corresponds to $e^3$, which happens to be 20.09 [Remember that $e^x$ is the traditional notation for the exponential function. In R, the exponential function is written `exp()`.]
[] A shorthand for `eee`. [There is no shorthand for names in R.]
[a] The value stored under the name `e` will be raised to the third power. [And if there is no object named `e`, you'll get an error message.]



**rev1-23** What's missing in the R expression `(x+3)(x+1)`? [rev1]

[] There's a missing closing parenthesis.
[] There's an extra closing parenthesis.
[+] The multiplication symbol, `*`, is missing. [It should be `(x + 3)*(x+1)`.]
[] Nothing

**rev1-24** If `x` has been assigned the value `pi/2`, what will be the value of the R expression `2 sin(x)`? [rev1]

[] 0, since $\sin(\pi/2) = 0$. [Actually, $\sin(\pi/2) = 1$, but that's not the only problem with this answer.]
[] 1, since $\sin(\pi/2) = 1$. [What about the `2`?]
[] 2, since $\sin(\pi/2) = 1$. [This would be right if the R expression had been written correctly.]
[] No value. The expression is in error. [It should presumably be `2*sin(x)`.]


**rev1-25** Which of these is the right way to translate $e^x$ into R? [rev1]

[] `e^x` [This is a bit of arithmetic, raising the value of whatever is stored in the object `e` to the power `x`. ]
[a] `exp(x)`
[] `e(x)` [There's no function named `e()`.]
[] There is no R equivalent. [Yes there is. Remember $e^x$ has a definite meaning in traditional notation.]

**rev1-26** In traditional notation, $$\text{Celsius}(\text{Fahrenheit}) \equiv \frac{5}{9} (\text{Fahrenheit} - 32)$$ defines a function named `Celsius()`. This of the following correctly defines that function in R? [rev1]

[] `Celsius(Fahrenheit) <- makeFun(5*(Fahrenheit-32)/9)` [The left side of the assignment operator `<-` should be simply the name of the function, in this case `Celsius`.]
[] `Celsius <- makeFun(5/9*Fahrenheit - 32 ~ Fahrenheit)` [This is missing the grouping parentheses needed for the correct formula: `(5/9)*(Fahrenheit - 32) ~ Fahrenheit]`
[] `Celsius() <- makeFun(5*(Fahrenheit-32)/9 ~ Fahrenheit)` [The `()` in `Celsius()` are not allowed in an R name.]
[+] `Celsius <- makeFun(5*(Fahrenheit-32)/9 ~ Fahrenheit)`
[] `Celsius(Fahrenheit) <- makeFun(5*(Fahrenheit-32)/9 ~ Fahrenheit)` [Everything is good, but the name on the left side of the assignment operator `<-` should be simply `Celsius`]

**rev1-27** You are modeling the population of *E. coli* growing in optimal conditions. (Optimal for the *E. coli*, not for you!)  In R, you've written <br>`population <- makeFun(100*exp(hours) ~ hours)`<br>What's the correct definition in traditional notation? [rev1]

[] $\text{population} \equiv 100 e^\text{hours}$
[] $\text{population}(t) \equiv 100 e^\text{hours}$ [The argument should be called hours, not t.]
[a] $\text{population}(\text{hours}) \equiv 100 e^\text{hours}$
[] None of the above.
