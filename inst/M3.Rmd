[a] yes [The function is concave up to the left of $x=0$, and concave down to the right. The concavity c70hanges at $x=0$ (although the exact point is hard to make out in the graph). A point where the concavity changes is an inflection point.]
[] no [The concavity changes from positive on the left of the graph to negative on the right. So there must be an inflection point in between.]
[] can't tell [Yes you can. You can see the curvature pretty easily on the graph.]

[] Zero
[a] All non-positive numbers [This is another way of saying, "The number line except for zero and negative numbers."]
