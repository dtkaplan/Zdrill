[] $t=0$ [When the argument to $\sin()$ is zero, the function output is at zero and increasing.]
[a] $t=3$ [$t=3$ makes the whole argument zero.]

You are completely exhausted. Time for a break. You want to walk along the hill, without any change of elevation. Which compass direction should you head in to get started?[Quiz-2]


[+] NW or SE
[] SE but not NW [Flat works both ways. If NW keeps you on a contour, so will SE (at least instantaneously).]
[] NW but not SE [Flat works both ways. If NW keeps you on a contour, so will SE (at least instantaneously).]
[] NE or SW [That's going downhill or uphill, respectively.]
