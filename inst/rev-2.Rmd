[] 0
[] 1
[] 2
[a] 3
[] 4 [4 is close to the argmax, but we're asking about the max.]

**r2-11** Which of these is a positive-going zero crossing of $g(t)$? $$g(t) \equiv \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}t-3\right)$$ [rev-2]

[a] $t=15/2\pi$ []
[] $t = 2 \pi/15$

[] $5/2\pi$
[a] $g(t)$ isn't periodic. [The only one of our basic modeling functions that is period is $\sin()$. The gaussian, that is, $\text{dnorm}()$, has just one bump and therefore isn't periodic.]

**r2-13** What is the period of $g(t)$? $$g(t) \equiv \frac{5}{\sin(2 \pi t)}$$  [rev-2]

[a] 1
[] 5 [Hint: 5 isn't inside the $\sin()$ parentheses.]
[] $2 \pi/5$ [Hint: 5 isn't inside the $\sin()$ parentheses.]
[] $5/2\pi$ [Hint: 5 isn't inside the $\sin()$ parentheses.]
[] $g(t)$ isn't periodic. [Since the $\sin()$ is periodic, $1/\sin()$ is also periodic.]

**r2-14** which of the following is a positive-going zero crossing of $g(t)$? $$\sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{5} (t - 3) \right)$$ [rev-2]

[] $t=-5$ [5 isn't in the $\sin()$ parentheses.]
[] $t=-3$ [When the argument to $\sin()$ is zero, the function output is at zero and increasing.]
[] $t=0$ [When the argument to $\sin()$ is zero, the function output is at zero and increasing.]
[a] $t=3$ [$t=3$ makes the whole argument zero.]
[] $t=5$ [5 isn't in the $\sin()$ parentheses.]
